      <p>Welcome to my portfolio site.</p>
      <p>
        A site to display my developer experience and be a central source
        for all my professional online presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically I've been an Animal Scientist, Accountant, British Soldier,
        and other various other interludes inbetween. LinkedIn is a better
        source for all that detail.

        I've coded as a hobby since secondary (late teens), with varying degrees
        of commitment and proficiency. Finances have also always been an
        interest and as a result has been the main source of my earlier project
        ideas. One problem I encountered was by delving in and out of coding,
        new tools and methods would appear and the projects would start from
        scatch, going from one framework and language to the next. This has not
        been entirely bad as I've been able to learn more about what has now
        become my trade. One con, is most of my earlier work as disappeared into
        the ether or not of any quality to display here.
      </p>
      <p>
        My commitment to this tade of software developing finally occured during
        my stint in the British Army. There I discovered and completed most of
        the JHUB Coding Scheme, participated in the 2023 Defence Hackathon and
        developed an in-house web app. This allowed me to learn modern coding
        practices and tools that were valued in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I love about the work; is the simple act of being able to create
        something useful that I can share with others. It involves both problem
        thinkning and creativity. Can be done anywhere, anytime, offline or
        online (preferred!).

        Current aspirations, as of Dec 2023, are to seek developer roles within
        the MoD. If there aren't any suitable roles or I'm unable to qualify for
        them, then I'll look for civilian jobs.
