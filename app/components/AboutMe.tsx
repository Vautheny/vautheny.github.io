      <p>
        I'm an Animal Scientist gone Accountant gone Army Soldier, with various
        interludes inbetween. My LinkedIn profile is best for all that kind of
        detail though. Whilst wearing all these hats I've coded as a hobby since
        secondary with varying degrees of commitment and proficiency. My guiding
        project has always been an all encompassing personal finance website.
        One of the problems I encountered was as I delved in and out, new tools
        and methods would appear and the project would start from scatch, going
        from one framework and language to the next. This has not been a totally
        bad thing as I've been able to learn more about what has now become my
        trade.

        Although never in a technical role, I would focus on those aspects that
        were. The world of excel accounting was a prime example, which as a
        result lead me to learn VBA. Even as a Port Operative in the army, my
        skills in IT meant I would end up completing their JHUB coding scheme,
        learning Python and React. I was even trawled to produce a web app for
        the RLC Association and attend the 2023 Defence Hackathon.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest lay with data manipulation and presentation, but any
        challenge that allows exposure to the fullstack is always preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
        Current aspirations are to seek developer roles within the MoD. If no
        suitable roles are found or I'm unable to qualify for them then civy
        alternatives will be the goal.
